The user will be prompted to fill out a survey of their feeling about particular items.
They will be required to enter their name, include a URL to a photo, and select an answer for all questions.

The application will then compare their answers with the answers of others who have filled out the survey.
The program will run an algorythm to mathmatically determine compatability, and display the name and picture of the closest match.

You can view the list of friends by clicking on the "API Friends List" at the bottom of the page.
You can view a picture of the friends in the list by entering a name and clicking on the "View Friend" button.
